This project is done for the requirement Software Development-II. 

Text processing refers to the discipline of mechanizing the creation or manipulation of electronic text. Processing texts has several steps such as processing raw text, categorized and tagging words, classify text, extracting information from text, analyzing the meaning of sentence and feature-based
grammar.
In this project we will give input text to the machine or give a passage to the machine, then we will ask questions about the given texts in the purpose of its meaning. After that, the machine will reply to the answer to that question. The question must follow a pattern. It can ask about the characteristics of the text. Then the machine will answer the associated question by matching itsâ€™ parts of the sentence.
